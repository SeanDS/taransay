Taransay Energy Monitor
=======================

This is an electricity, gas, temperature and humidity monitor and base station. It's
a remix of the [emonTx](https://github.com/openenergymonitor/emontx3) and
[emonTH](https://github.com/openenergymonitor/emonth2) from
[OpenEnergyMonitor](http://openenergymonitor.com/). The intention is to use the
firmware from these projects with minimal changes, and the
[emoncms](https://github.com/emoncms) data logging infrastructure as-is.

As of writing, the hardware is being tested. This readme will be expanded once the
bugs have been ironed out.
